// ES10 / FLAT() - DOES NOTHING if there are no nested arrays, but it means that it will do flatten the arrays and make sure that there are no more nested arrays 

// Array 1 does absolutely nothign
// Array 2 flattens it so that there are no more nested arrays
// Array 3 that the array is 100% flattened - it returns [1, 2, 3, 4, Array(1)] - Default flatten is 1, which is why it didn't quite flatten the array
